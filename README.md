# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a visual representation of a user interface that outlines the layout, structure, and functionality of a digital product, such as a website or application. Acting as a blueprint for the design process, wireframes showcase key elements like navigation and content placement, allowing designers and stakeholders to clarify ideas and concepts effectively. This early stage of design emphasizes user experience (UX) by mapping user journeys and interactions, facilitating usability testing and feedback integration.

The importance of wireframing lies in its ability to save time and resources, as it identifies potential design flaws before high-fidelity designs are developed. Wireframes enhance collaboration among designers, developers, and stakeholders by serving as a common point for discussions, ultimately leading to better design decisions. By establishing a clear visual hierarchy, wireframing creates intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that improve overall user satisfaction.
